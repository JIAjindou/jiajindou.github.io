  title: "A safety planning and control architecture applied to a quadrotor autopilot"
  venue: IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (R-AL), 2022
  description: "A sliding mode observer (SMO) based safety controller is implemented on the autopilot. The actuator saturation problem is analyzed and modeled as axis-coupled constraints. The B-spline curve is used to deal with the constraints due to its convex hull property."
